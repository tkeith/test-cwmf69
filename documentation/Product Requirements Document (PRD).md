# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the comprehensive requirements for developing a delayed messaging application. The document serves as a reference for:
- Development team members implementing the system
- Quality assurance engineers testing the application
- Project managers overseeing development progress
- Stakeholders reviewing technical specifications

## 1.2 Scope
The delayed messaging application is a communication platform that introduces an intentional delay between message sending and delivery. The system will:

- Provide secure user authentication through username/password login
- Enable users to send text messages to other registered users
- Implement a mandatory 30-60 second delay between message transmission and delivery
- Display message status (sent, pending, delivered) to users
- Manage message queuing and scheduled delivery
- Support real-time user presence and availability

Key benefits include:
- Reduced pressure for immediate responses
- Enhanced message anticipation
- Unique user experience differentiating from instant messaging
- Potential reduction in messaging anxiety

Out of scope:
- Voice or video messaging
- File attachments
- Group messaging
- Message editing after sending
- Message recall functionality
